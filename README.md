### Project Description

In this project we I created a little web shop with a cart. As the consumer you can add items, delete items, and it also displays the total sum amount.
Here we used and implemented material Ui, reactQuery, typeScript, and StyleComponents for the best possible handling and ux.

### Merchandise Page

We have a react component that makes a fetch request to an API to gather all the data, and then display the 
items to the UI. The react component renders each item to the UI.




### Items in Shopping Cart Page

The User can add an item to the cart. Also increment the amount of a particular item, as well as decrement. Depending on how many items are in the cart, the total sum is displayed.
